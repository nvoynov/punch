% Punching Domains

Having described your domain by using Punch::DSL, you can easily generate lots more things than just Ruby code. It might fit perfectly for generating domain documentation, sketching future domain interfaces, etc.

Change `domain` setting in `punch.yml` in appropriate domain name, when you want a separate namespace for the domain.
